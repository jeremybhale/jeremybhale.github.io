<article class="post-257859 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-guide category-metaphor-refantazio entry" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline">Metaphor ReFantazio 100% Walkthrough</h1>

<p>Welcome to the&nbsp;Metaphor ReFantazio 100% Walkthrough. This 100% Schedule Guide&nbsp;includes all Trophies &amp; Achievements, Follower Ranks, Archetypes, Quests, Gold Beetle Collectibles, Recipes, Drawings, Debate Candidates, Books, Towns, and everything else.</p>

<p>By following this you will have all possible Trophies/Achievements at the end of the first playthrough. The only trophy that requires a second playthrough is&nbsp;<strong>Closing the Book</strong>, because the Superboss spawns exclusively&nbsp;in New Game+. All other trophies will unlock on the&nbsp;first playthrough&nbsp;with this guide. You can select any difficulty you want, but Storyteller is&nbsp;<span class="yKMVIe">recommended</span>&nbsp;for grinding efficiency, as you will earn Money,&nbsp;MAG,&nbsp;and&nbsp;XP at a much faster rate.</p>
<p>For ranking up your followers, there isn’t anything special you need to do. Unlike the Persona series, it doesn’t require having a matching Persona, or in this case Archetype, as you don’t need to pick any specific dialogues when you spend time with them and they’ll always rank up after each follower event. Picking the “correct” dialogue will only reward you with extra Magla, which is pointless since the amount you get is very little, so you can pick whatever dialogue you want whenever you spend time with followers. You can press&nbsp;<img src="https://www.powerpyx.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/left.png" alt=":left:" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"> while in town or on your Gauntlet Runner to quickly bring up your follower tab and see who you can spend time with. If you see a lit-up pink follower icon, you can&nbsp;spend time with them. If you see a grayed-out follower icon, you can spend time with them but you haven’t met a certain prerequisite.</p>
<p>Be aware&nbsp;that the majority of items for crafting Vessels/Masks come from random enemy drops. This will be different for every player.&nbsp;Just make sure you’re crafting Masks/Vessels whenever you can, and stock up on Mask pieces at the Weary Shopkeeper in Brilehaven if you need extra Mask pieces. The Weary Shopkeeper sells different Mask pieces for each in-game day and will only sell you one of each Mask piece a day. In a similar vein, you can buy Talismans from the Hunter on Virga Island, but you can only buy 1 of each Talisman per playthrough. You can increase the item drop chance by using skills learned from the Merchant Archetype.&nbsp;All created Vessels and Masks carry over into New Game+. If you didn’t get enough random drops on the first playthrough you will get more than enough in New Game+.</p>

<p>If you make any mistakes during your playthrough, there will be some extra time towards the end of the game, so there’s no need to worry if you make&nbsp;a couple mistakes. You’ll need a 2nd playthrough anyway on New Game+ to fight the Superboss,&nbsp;and you can always clean up mistakes there.&nbsp;Feel free to save in a different manual save slot each day in case you make a mistake and want to reload.</p>
<p>During your down time, there will also be activities you can partake in that increase your Royal Virtues. Some of these have dialogue options, and others do not. Some of them will give you more points based off picking the correct dialogue option. There is a degree of randomness to this for some events, so to play it perfectly safe, it’s recommended to make a save just incase you end up choosing the wrong option and getting less than the points state in the guide.</p>

The dragon is weak to ice, so try to get at least 2 characters with Mage Rank 2 so you can spam ice attacks.

<li>Grand Trad, Catacombs Entrance – Enter the dungeon. We’re aiming to complete the dungeon within a single day, which would be nearly impossible if not for the Mage’s Magic Recovery passive that lets you regain 1 MP for your entire party every time an enemy is stunned/defeated on the field as long as its equipped to the Main Character. The dungeon is very long and with a very small MP pool, you’ll run out quickly. Thankfully that skill combined with the enemies that infinitely spawn from the Trance Crystals in the second part of the dungeon, you basically have infinite MP. While you’re grinding at the Trance Crystals to regain MP, be careful of the Mage’s Area of Effect basic attack that will also damage the Trance Crystal. If you find the Trance Crystal getting low HP, enter the Magla Hollow and exit it to reset its HP back to full.</li>
<li>While in the dungeon, try to get the Healer Archetype to Rank 10, so you can turn in the quest “<strong>More’s Task: Foreword and Prologue</strong>” and accept “<strong>More’s Task Chapter One: Ordeal</strong>” to progress his follower rank.&nbsp;<strong>(Rank 2) (+4 Imagination)</strong></li>

<li>Martira, Blind Well Alley – Enter the dungeon. This dungeon isn’t nearly as long as the first dungeon so MP isn’t as big of an issue, but you should still try and use it sparingly since we want to complete the dungeon in one go. A good idea might be to level up the Thief archetype on every character to level 11 so you can unlock Plunder Magic and use skill inheritance to have it on everyone, so you can always steal MP whenever you’re low instead of just relying on the Mage’s Magic Recovery skill.</li>
<li>Throughout the dungeon you’ll have to sneak past a specific enemy. You can fight them, but it isn’t worth it as you don’t get any special rewards for beating them.</li>

This is extremely useful as they’re difficult to come across certain ones. They cost 25,000 reeve each and he rotates his stock every day.

<ul>
<li><strong>Afternoon</strong>
<ul>
<li>Our main goal is to chart a course to the Spire of Blind Faith, which will always have the Heat weather in affect. Using Edeni’s ability here is useless as it will take 4 days to travel there due to stopping at the Orbwise Path, so you’ll just have to bear with the loss of extra press turns during battle. The same goes for the Orbwise Path, but that one isn’t as big of a deal as it mostly consists of lower level enemies.</li>

<ul>
<li>Spend time with all your followers and then watch the final scenes of the game. After the final cutscene ends after the credits, you’ll unlock <img src="https://www.powerpyx.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/silver.png" alt=":silver:" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;">&nbsp;<strong>Coronation of the King</strong>. Make sure you save your Clear Save Data, as you’ll be needing it.</li>

<p><strong>New Game+ Run</strong></p>
<p>You’ll now need to start a New Game+ run using your Clear Sava Data as there is a superboss that you can only fight on New Game+. Make sure when you choose the difficult,<strong>&nbsp;DO NOT</strong>&nbsp;select Storyteller as you cannot fight the superboss on Storyteller difficulty and you cannot change the difficulty later if you select it. The lowest difficulty you can select is Easy. Below is some stuff you’ll want to focus on your New Game+ run, since while you can fight the superboss right away, he’s way too powerful to actually take on at the start so you’ll have to pretty much do an entire playthrough again to be ready to fight him.</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll want to rank up all your Followers again since while levels of Archetypes transfer over, the Archetypes themselves don’t.</li>
<li>You’ll want to grind Gauntlet Shrooms, Lord of the Lake, and Queen’s Honey Jar to make as many Sublime Spoonful’s as you can. Before you start cooking however, make sure you have Maria at Rank 7 so not only can you cook without passing time, but you’ll also get double the amount of cooking items. The Sublime Spoonful food is extremely useful in fighting the superboss.</li>
<li>If you never unlocked <img src="https://www.powerpyx.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/silver.png" alt=":silver:" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;">&nbsp;<strong>Summon Mask Time</strong>, you’ll want to focus on crafting the rest of the Masks and Vessels you missed in your first playthrough. You’ll also want to get every other trophy you missed along the way as well.</li>
