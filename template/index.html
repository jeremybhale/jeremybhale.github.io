				<p>

				<h3>FOR THE LOVE OF SCIENCE</h3>
				<p>		
				You’re safe for now, but you’ll need to do something for your new friend before he will trust you. In the lab where the virus was created, there are machines which will weaken its power. It’s up to you to sneak into the high security facility, power up the equipment, and escape before anyone knows you’re there.

				<h3>THE LION'S DEN</h3>
				<p>

It’s all part of an effort to get you into the private study of one of the wealthiest and dangerous men on the planet. It’s time to end his reign, but can you find the key before security forces find you?
