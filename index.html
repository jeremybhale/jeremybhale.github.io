				<h2 class="section-header"><a href="SI/index.html">Space Invaders</a></h2>
				<img src="img\shot.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
				<p class="description">I got to thinking about how little space was available on old arcade systems, and I wanted to see how small I could make something similar. It's not complete, and not quite as small as the original. Arrow keys move, space bar fires.</p>

			<div class="bordered section">
				<h2 class="section-header"><a href="L/index.html">The Leshy</a></h2>
				<img src="img\shot.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
				<p class="description">I love puzzles, scavenger hunts, and mysteries. One summer, I took a photography contest and turned it into an opportunity to start a little game for my friends. Finding all the hidden items would reveal a clue.</p>

			<div class="bordered section">
				<h2 class="section-header"><a href="PT/index.html">Pick Three</a></h2>
				<img src="img\shot.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
				<p class="description">I participated in prototyping a gamified way to make studying more fun. This is a stripped down version of the game. Answering questions correctly earns points, and there's a chance to double your score.</p>

				<h2 class="section-header"><a href="F/index.php">Fill in the Trip</a></h2>
				<img src="img\shot.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
				<p class="description">I was tired of seeing all these commercials for travel booking sites. They all said they were different, but I couldn't see it. How would it work if it was different? Maybe if you start out not knowing where you wanted to go.</p>

			<div class="bordered section">
				<h2 class="section-header"><a href="CW/index.html">Clara Walks</a></h2>
				<img src="img\shot.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
				<p class="description">I've always like the idea of making cartoons. Usually I don't have the patience for it, but I liked the pig from the gamification project so I went for it. Try the left, right, and up arrow keys.</p>

				<h2 class="section-header"><a href="LI/index.html">Locus Imperium</a></h2>
				<img src="img\shot.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
				<p class="description">This is another example of a page I made for a puzzle, though this one came about several years ago. I was experimenting with navigation styles, and to this day I still load this up to spin the orbit with the mouse.</p>

				<h2 class="section-header"><a href="SVG/index.html">SVG Map</a></h2>
				<img src="img\shot.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
				<p class="description">I worked on a project with a vendor who had a hard time keeping up with our requirements. I said to myself, "I could do this in an hour". It took a bit longer than an hour, but this basic SVG map worked a lot better than what was delivered.</p>
